========

The "Course settings" block (heretofore named, "Quickset") has changed dramatically.  

NOTES:

1. "Update settings" is the default focus button so <ENTER> will cause that button to be submitted with any changes to:
Students see course?
2. Grades visible?
3. Visible sections
4. "Edit sections" displays this screen (in screenshots):

Studying this screen you will discover it does everything it appears to do:

- Delete course sections from anywhere in the sequence (if resources exist in that section they will be moved to the "Zero" section -- a warning pops-up to remind you)
- Add sections in the middle or anywhere else
- Quickly reorder sections with no clicks and no reliance on how AJAX is feeling today.
- Edit the names for any of the sections which is particularly handy when first setting up a course (think of the "click savings"
